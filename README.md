# git_global_status

This is a CLI tool for those who keep forgetting to commit/push their work on time. It runs through a directory and finds all
repositories that are not up to date.

Usage: ggs <path_to_directory>

Move the binary in Releases to /usr/bin or other directories in PATH for global access. Don't forget to make it executable.
